## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Repository for my Masterthesis which reviews and supplements a couple of testing environments and displays the state-of-the-art RL for multi-agent application in cooperation with humans.

Key features of the **MARL Evaluation App**:

- Webapplication with interactive overview of the environments, agents and policys
- Different Frameworks implemented like OpenAI Gym, PettingZoo and Rllib
- Work In Progress, therefore this is a living repo which lives from feedback and input


<details open>
<summary>Additional info</summary>
<br>

This is the result of my Masterthesis about cooperation between humans and autonomous agents. A lot of research and time is gone into this project and it will be maintained. This is a topic which require further research. A entry point into this topic can be this Web-Application. Me, the dev, wishes that it will become a building block for further research.

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
- [Stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
- [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo)
- [Rllib (Ray)](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib)
- [Unity Engine](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/)
- [ML-Agents for Unity Engine](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_19_docs)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, make a new virtualenv, clone the repository

Virtualenv:
```sh
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv marl_eval_app

virtualenv activate marl_eval_app
```

Pyenv with version management:

Install Pyenv, then:
```sh
pyenv install 3.9.13

pyenv 3.9.13 marl_eval_app

pyenv shell marl_eval_app
```

The easiest way to install the required packages into the newly created virtual environment is by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements
```

### Usage

#### Run the environment
To start up the Flask instance and the npm server (for the Flask-VUE-Bootstrap Architecture which the website is based on) run

```sh
python launch.py
```

#### Variables reference
